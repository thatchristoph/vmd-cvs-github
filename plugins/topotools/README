VMD topotools package. Version 1.3
Copyright (c) 2009,2010,2011,2012 by Axel Kohlmeyer <akohlmey@gmail.com>
-------------------

A collection of Tcl commands to manipulate, build, read
and write topologies (i.e. bonds, angles, dihedrals, etc.
and their corresponding properties (type, order, etc.).

Please contact me at akohlmey@gmail.com, if you have any 
additional ideas or want to implement a specific feature.

Updated and bugfix versions are also available from:

That page also links to tutorials demonstrating the use
of the package for different purposes.

TODO:
  - improve "topo setbonds" to be more efficient for large sets 
    of bonds to be added.
  - topo copybonds <fromsel> <tosel>
  - topo guessbonds <sel>  (use bondsrecalc and restore bonds 
    outside the selection)
  - support for writing non-orthogonal cells
    (triclinic cell read is implemented and tested).
  - support for non-orthogonal cells with replicatemols.
  - support for generating and replicating bonds across
    periodic boundaries (for molecular crystal models).
  - better documentation
  - more tools to read/write custom topology files 
    (e.g. gromacs top?, amber parmtop?)
  - API to read/parse/store force field database information.
